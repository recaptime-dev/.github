# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, we're Recap Time Squad!

Welcome to our GitHub organization and GitLab namespace! We're an all-remote
open-source team founded in the Philippines, mostly specialized in the backends
and all things documentations.

resident backend Node.js and Deno developer around.

### â™¥ Supporting the crew

fiscal host, and once everything is ready,
all donations to the team will be dedicated towards keeping our projects maintained
and our team members (as well as community maintainers and moderators) happy.

  <summary>Why you got an rebrand?</summary>
  
  We rebranded from The Pins Team to Recap Time Squad not only because our old domain
  `madebythepins.tk`, got domain hijacked, as well as making to more professional with a `.dev` domain.
