# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're Recap Time (or just Recap Time Squad, formerly known as [The Pins Team](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub)), an organization of sorts for
different open-source projects we host and sometimes we build ourselves, through we're not officially a company yet. We're behind different projects
including [Verification Process Endpoint](https://gitlab.com/RecapTime/verify) (an project to confirm/verify users the open-source and transparent way and to find any possible alternative accounts), [Community Lores](https://gitlab.com/community-lores) (documentation arc for wikis and docs we maintain/host) and [Gitpodified Workspace Images](https://gitlab.com/gitpodify/gitpodified-workspace-images) (opinionated Gitpod workspace images based on upstream, with additional tools for your needs).

### ðŸ‘¥ Meet The Team

resident backend Node.js and Deno developer

### â™¥ Supporting the crew

We think we want to be independent from ads and VC hellscapes, but this might make us ~~out of the business~~ abandon projects completely
due to burnout and mostly working on our free time. Maintaining open-source projects take time and resources, so if you want to help us keep afloat,
thanks for support but we're currently ironing out how do we accept donations.

  <summary>Why you got an rebrand?</summary>
  
  We rebranded from The Pins Team to Recap Time Squad not only because our old domain, `madebythepins.tk`, got hijacked with domain parking with ad cringe. Second, we'll go on full gear
  on the development on that fediverse superapp soon.
